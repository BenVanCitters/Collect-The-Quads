# Collect-The-Quads
Pac-man-like Quake Mod 

Changes all items into Q-glyphs that need to be collected to get points(kills/frags).  Once all of the quad-glyphs have been cleared from a level a countdown starts and then everyone is killed and the quads are reset.

Notes:
- Killing other players no longer adds points, but can still be done.
- Players start with a rocket launcher and 100 rockets- should be more than enough
- There is no way to get power-ups, health, other weapons, or armor.

## USE
This was developed for PC/windows with a Steam install and so far it has only been developed within this environment and I make no gaurantees that it works outside of that.

Copy the `progs.dat` file to
```
"c:\Users\%USERNAME%\Saved Games\Nightdive Studios\Quake\mpmod"\progs.dat
"c:\Users\%USERNAME%\Saved Games\Nightdive Studios\Quake\Id1"\progs.dat
```
Once this is done start the mod for single and multiplayer by launching the re-release, opening the console ('`' key) and entering the command: 'game mpmod' and pressing return.
